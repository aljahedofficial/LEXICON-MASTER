1.2 Core Mission
Transform unstructured text documents into actionable vocabulary intelligence through intelligent extraction, enrichment, visualization, and comparative analysis—enabling users to understand, learn, and leverage vocabulary patterns from diverse sources.2. VISUAL DESIGN PHILOSOPHY2.1 Design Aesthetic: "Modern Academic Luxury"

Overall tone: Professional, sophisticated, trustworthy, yet innovative
Feel: Like a high-end research dashboard meets modern SaaS application
Color Palette:

Primary: Deep Navy Blue (#1A2a4A) - Trust, professionalism, intelligence
Secondary: Vibrant Teal/Cyan (#00D9FF) - Modern, energetic, clarity
Accent: Warm Gold (#FFB84D) - Sophistication, highlighting key data
Success: Emerald Green (#10B981) - Positive actions, completion
Alert: Coral Red (#FF6B6B) - Warnings, errors (softer than standard red)
Neutral: Slate Gray (#64748B) - Secondary text, borders
Background: Off-white with subtle gradient (#F8FAFC to #F1F5F9)


2.2 Typography Strategy

Display Font: "Georgia" or "Playfair Display" - Elegant, authoritative headers
Body Font: "Segoe UI" or "Lato" - Clean, highly readable for tables and data
Monospace: "Fira Code" or "Monaco" - For word displays and technical elements
Font hierarchy: Clear distinction between H1 (28px), H2 (22px), H3 (18px), body (14-16px)
2.3 Visual Principles

Data visualization: Charts with smooth animations, hover interactions showing detailed tooltips
Micro-interactions: Buttons with subtle hover effects, smooth transitions on all interactive elements
Depth & Layering: Strategic use of shadows, glass-morphism cards, layered information density
